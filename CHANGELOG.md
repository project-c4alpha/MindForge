# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- **Progressive Disclosure Architecture**: Restructured all skill files to follow a three-level loading system for improved token efficiency:
  - **Level 1 (Metadata)**: Skill name and description always loaded (~100 words)
  - **Level 2 (SKILL.md body)**: Core concepts and quick reference loaded when skill triggers (<500 lines)
  - **Level 3 (References)**: Detailed patterns, templates, and examples loaded only when needed

### Added

- **References Subdirectories**: Created `references/` folders for 12 skills in both English and Chinese (24 total):
  - `api-design`: OpenAPI templates, GraphQL patterns, pagination & rate limiting, common patterns
  - `database-design`: Sharding strategies, query optimization, migration & backup
  - `design-pattern`: Pattern implementations with code examples
  - `enterprise-java`: Class templates, response patterns
  - `frontend-svelte`: API patterns, forms & styling, testing & performance & a11y, deployment patterns
  - `git-guru`: Advanced features, workflows & scenarios
  - `go-development`: File templates for clean architecture
  - `javascript-typescript`: Express API patterns, React patterns, testing patterns
  - `python-development`: FastAPI patterns, Django patterns, testing patterns
  - `system-architecture`: Architecture templates
  - `tech-documentation`: API docs, architecture docs, deployment docs templates
  - `testing`: Language-specific test patterns (JUnit, pytest, Jest, testify)

### Technical Details

- All SKILL.md files now stay under 500 lines for optimal context loading
- 56 new reference files created (28 English + 28 Chinese)
- Total reduction of ~12,500 lines moved from main skill files to references
- Maintains consistent structure across English (`en`) and Chinese (`zh-cn`) versions

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **Modern Go Guidelines**: Added `modern-go.md` supporting file to `go-development` skill with comprehensive version-specific syntax guidelines from Go 1.0 to Go 1.26+, including:
  - Dynamic Go version detection via shell command
  - Modern alternatives for legacy patterns (slices, maps, cmp packages)
  - Version-specific best practices (omitzero, b.Loop(), t.Context(), wg.Go(), etc.)
  - Before/after code examples for each feature

### Changed

- **Simplified Skill Frontmatter**: Removed `allowed-tools` field from all 38 skill files. Claude Code's permission system handles tool access control appropriately without requiring explicit allowlists in skill definitions.
